A guessing game, with host and guest entering integers.  
The host enters a number.  
The guest tries to guess the number.  
If the guest got it right, the program displays "Correct!"  
If the guest got it wrong, the program displays "Incorrect!"

First solved with an if else statement in this program.

Same code using a ternary operator instead.  
The condition is first. If it's true, then the part  
after the ? is executed. If it's false, then the part  
after the : is executed
